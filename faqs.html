          <h3>WHAT IS TranSoniCa?</h3>
          <p>Feel free to call it TranSoniCa or T-Card. T-Card is a contactless stored value card that provides
            customers
            a simple, safe and secure way to pay for anything. You do not need a phone or photo ID to use our service.
            It also works within 10 cm hence you do not need to take your T-Card off your wallet or purse. Another
            cool thing is that, T-Card is multipurpose; It could be used for boarding buses, making purchases at shops,
            restaurants, hotels and hostels and even paying bills. T-card is secured, highly durable and reliable. All
            you
            need is to make a one-time payment for the card and regularly load it with money for transaction. Just touch
            your TranSoniCa to the ticket validator and the fare is automatically deducted from your card. It can be
            loaded and used as many times as desired.</p>

          <section>
             <h3>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE WITH TranSoniCa?</h3>
             <p>
               <li><b>Generalized card:</b> it contains no personal information</li>
               <li><b>Personalized card:</b> one could have a passport-sized picture, name inscribed on his/her own
                 card,
                 and other personal information on the card for easy access</li>
             </p>
          </section>

          <h3>HOW DO I USE TranSoniCa?</h3>
          <p>Simply use your T-Card for any transaction or payment with our partner vendors. It is simply tap and go.
            No need to join long queues due to slow transaction rates. Use it anywhere, at any time. Your long-searched
            partner is right here. T-Card is here to make sure that you do not carry money with you.
            You could lose this money either unknowingly or by theft. You do not need to carry coin-change on you
            anymore. All these are being taken care of by your T-Card buddy.
            </p>

          <h3>WHERE DO I GET IT?</h3>
          <p>The T-Card can be purchased at TranSoniCa’s ATMs inside the banking square, Central Cafeteria and the
            ones situated in various halls and hostels on campus. You could also grab your personal card from our office
            or top-up agents.
          </p>

          <h3>HOW DO I GET THE MOST OUT OF IT?</h3>
          <p>Your T-Card is issued to you for your regular use. If your Personalized T-Card is issued on or after 1st
            October 2020 and has not had any add value or payment transaction for three years, it will become an
            Inactive
            T-Card and you may have to pay the Inactive T-Card Administrative Fee. If you no longer need it, please
            return it to us and collect the deposit and remaining value (if any) to avoid the Inactive T-Card
            Administrative
            Fee.
          </p>

          <h3>HOW DO I REPORT ON A STOLEN CARD?</h3>
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur et sed adipiscing elit. Curabitur
            vel sem sit dolor neque semper magna lorem ipsum.</p>

          <h3>HOW DO I GET A REFUND?</h3>
          <p>TranSoniCa users do not need to request or apply for an incomplete transaction refund – these are queued
            for processing automatically, and only need to be collected.
            Refunds can be collected at any TranSoniCa Service Point, through the TranSoniCa App, from our top-up
            agents or through an TranSoniCa PC Reader. Pending refunds will also be collected if detected when the TCard
            is used or reloaded at any shop (regardless of the transaction value), or when paying bus fares on buses
            with T-Card.</p>

          <h3>HOW DO I REPORT ON A MALFUNCTIONING CARD?</h3>
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur et sed adipiscing elit. Curabitur
              vel sem sit dolor neque semper magna lorem ipsum.</p>

          <h3>WHY DOES AN INCOMPLETE TRANSACTION OCCUR?</h3>
          <p>An incomplete transaction may occur when a T-Card is removed too quickly from the TranSoniCa reader,
            or when a T-Card is presented at the reader at the same time with another T-Card or contactless smart card.
            When an incomplete transaction happens, the "dood" sound is not heard and the remaining value is not
            shown on the screen. If the cashier thinks that the payment has not successfully gone through, you may be
            asked to pay by other means, even if your T-Card deducts the sum from its remaining value. When this
            happens, tap the TranSoniCa on the reader again to hear the “dood” signal for a complete transaction and
            see the remaining value. This will NOT cause a double deduction. If there is no response to the second tap,
            make sure no other TranSoniCa or contactless smart cards are placed too close to the card while tapping.
            For an incomplete (and therefore unsuccessful) transaction, the cashier may ask you to pay by other means,
            even if your TranSoniCa deducts the sum from its remaining value.
            For more clarification, please contact our 24h customer service.</p>

          <h3>HOW DO I AVOID INCOMPLETE TRANSATIONS?</h3>
          <p>Under such circumstances, the customer should tap the T-Card on the same reader again until the "dood"
            sound is heard and the remaining value is shown on the screen. This will NOT cause double deduction.
            Should the reader continue to have no response, please check if the T-Card is placed together with another
            T-Card or contactless smart card.
            To prevent incomplete transactions from occurring, don’t remove a T-Card too quickly from a TranSoniCa
            reader when tapping, and separate your TranSoniCa and other contactless smart cards for use in a wallet, or
            simply pull out the T-Card completely when using it.
            For more clarification, please contact our 24h customer service.</p>

          <h3>WHAT ARE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS?</h3>
